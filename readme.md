# Geotech Information Services location analysis 

This project is designed to explore areas around Melbourne to determine which might be most suitable for me if I were to be working at Geotech Information Services (GIS).

This analysis may include:
- Clustering of areas Melbourne.
- Statistical and/or regression rankings of areas.
- Isochrones/Isodistances from GIS.

Criteria to consider include:
- Rental costs
- Distance/time to GIS (Driving/PT/cycling/walking)
- Area liveability score (based on other studies or my own criteria)
- Density/type of nearby amenities
